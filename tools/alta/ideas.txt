* Prepare API with input image and output oracle score + Understand ROS
* How to use results from previous heights???
* Use 'inter_area' instead of 'bilinear' interpolation, or an explicit antialiasing filter
* Freeze some layers to reduce overfitting. Some nets don't have this option yet (e.g. segformer)
* Use more datasets to improve generalization (either pretrain or mix with Alta). List of relevant datasets exists in folder AI_datasets and also in a
document in my drive.
* Change class weights
* Label smoothing - either uniform, or according to semantic closeness
* Display softmax score. It seems that smaller scores are obtained in the vicinity of edge pixels,
hence it can be used to eliminate small objects in high altitude!!!
It also depends on the decoder interpolation, and probably on the patch size (in transformers)
* Show difference between cnn and transformer using the mis-annotated image

* Metaformer - according to the paper, it's slightly better than pvt (on ADE dataset), which is much worse than
segformer, with similar speed. Maybe it's due to the segformer's decoder?
* Using antialiasing filter during inference only, the small columns disappear only at 15+ filter size (at 100m),
 and results overall decrease markedly.
* Using antialiasing filter during training and inference, ...?
* Showing the softmax output, it seems that some of the wrong predictions have also lowish score (<0.9). But certainly not all.
